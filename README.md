We have added 2 Out Of The Box Features
a) The Attendance Feature has a very Unique Feature, Using Google Map API we have created a system in which attendance will be marked on the basis of geolocation. Admins can create a virtual radius and the students with their devices under the radius can only mark their attendance.
b) We Have Created a WhatsApp ChatBot. the bot is so systematically designed and matched with the database schema. it supports various features, some of them being it sends reminder to the students who have pending assignments. the reminder is send before 24 hours, before 18 hours and before 1 hour of the submission time.
the bot also sends recently updates notices by admins to everyone.
it can send daily quotes to desired users.
upon asking it also sends programming questions from different websites
also user can modify the difficulty levels as they desire.
this is a one stop solution desired to easify and solve all the problems of college system. we have added as many features as we could in 4 days. and if given chance we can add many such helpful and out of the box features.
